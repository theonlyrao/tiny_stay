### Overview
This site was built by Ashwin Rao, Josh Washke and Patrick Hardy in the first week of module 3 at the Turing School of Software and Design. 

We adapted an existing tool-rental application to handle multitenancy and improved UX. We solved new techninical challenges in the implementation of several features, including a datepicker that grays out dates that are already reserved and the ability to search by reservation date and location.

In this project we wrote and implemented user stories, designed and implemented a postgres database, and deployed production-quality code on heroku. This site also integrates geocoder, gmaps4rails, jquery UI elements, bootstrap and AWS with paperclip.
